- When a widget (e.g., 'MessageBuilder') is based on Top, calling
  'Top.close' in inappropriate places (e.g., in
  'MessageBuilder.__init__' after packing the widget) results in
  'Top' having zero sizes (even when 'Geometry.set' is used).
  This is avoided if we set 'AutoCr' to 'False' when creating widgets
  requiring 'Top.close' before 'show' for the 1st time (e.g., 'EntryC').
